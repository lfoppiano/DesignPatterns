This project is an attempt to apply my current update on design patterns.

The structure I used is divided in two parts, the definition and the sample:
 - the definition is showing an implementation from theoretical point of view
 - the sample is showing one or more practical examples

For any remarks and suggestions, please feel free to contact me.

Design pattern currently implemented:
 - Strategy: org.foppiano.designpatten.strategy
 - Observer: org.foppiano.designpattern.observer
    a) definition with JAVA API (org.foppiano.designpattern.observer.java)
    b) definition with own classes (org.foppiano.designpattern.observer.own)
